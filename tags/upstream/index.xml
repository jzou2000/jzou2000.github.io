      <description>Create An Upstream Repo There are two types of repositories:
bare: repositories do not have a working copy and you can push to them, for example, repositories that you get in github. Bare repositories work as upstreams. non-bare: repositories that you are working on, with a working copy. Repositories that you clone or init are non-bare by default. You can&amp;rsquo;t (by default) and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t push to non-bare repos. Note: technically, you can push to a non-bare repo (see below), but that is not a common practice.</description>
