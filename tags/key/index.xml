cat $HOME/.ssh/config host my_alias # this is the alias name hostname some.host.remote # real host name user john # optional, otherwise use john@my_alias Create ssh-key ssh-keygen ssh-keygen generates a pair of RSA key (private id_rsa and public id_rsa.pub) at $HOME/.ssh
Copy the public key file to remote host (john@host.remote) ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub john@host.remote The command add an entry in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote host. After the public key is added, you can ssh login without password.</description>

Introduction OpenSSL is a versatile command line tool that can be used for a large variety of tasks related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and HTTPS (HTTP over TLS). This cheat sheet style guide provides a quick reference to OpenSSL commands that are useful in common, everyday scenarios. This includes OpenSSL examples of generating private keys, certificate signing requests, and certificate format conversion. It does not cover all of the uses of OpenSSL.</description>
