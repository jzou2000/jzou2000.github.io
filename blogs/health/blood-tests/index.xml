      <description>What is a CA 19-9 blood test? This test measures the amount of a protein called CA 19-9 (cancer antigen 19-9) in the blood. CA 19-9 is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body.
Healthy people can have small amounts of CA 19-9 in their blood. High levels of CA 19-9 are often a sign of pancreatic cancer.</description>

      <description>What is a CEA test? CEA stands for carcinoembryonic antigen. It is a protein found in the tissues of a developing baby. CEA levels normally become very low or disappear after birth. Healthy adults should have very little or no CEA in their body.
This test measures the amount of CEA in the blood, and sometimes in other body fluids. CEA is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body.</description>

      <description>Introduction A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test. It&amp;rsquo;s used to look at overall health and find a wide range of conditions, including anemia, infection and leukemia.
A complete blood count test measures the following:
Red blood cells, which carry oxygen White blood cells, which fight infection Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells Hematocrit, the amount of red blood cells in the blood Platelets, which help blood to clot A complete blood count can show unusual increases or decreases in cell counts.</description>

      <description>Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)
What is a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test? A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys have tiny filters called glomeruli. These filters help remove waste and excess fluid from the blood. A GFR test estimates how much blood passes through these filters each minute.
A GFR can be measured directly, but it is a complicated test, requiring specialized providers.</description>

      <description>What is a hemoglobin test? A hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin, sometimes abbreviated to Hb or Hgb, is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.
What is it used for? This test can be used for multiple purposes. Firstly, it may be ordered as part of a complete blood count to assess overall health. It can also be used to screen for or diagnose certain conditions, such as anemia.</description>
